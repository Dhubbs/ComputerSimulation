# ComputerSimulation
Simulated Computer made in a software called DLS. this does not follow a typical architecture and was built by me trying my best to solve issues as I saw them. At this point it is not technically turing complete as conditionals have not been implemented. The components for jumps has been put in however not implemented in code
